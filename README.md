# Intro

This application is built to demo an exmaple of how to use axios within React. The aim is to keep this application updated ensuring we demo the best and latest way to use axios. We will be using Hooks within this application so we will stick with using functional components. 

# Axios

Axios is used to work with API's within react. The Axios package makes it easy to work with data that is being either pushed, pulled or changed through a API, enabling you to use little code for great gains. 

# Improvements

We can improve the current codebase through the following:
    Deconstruct the app.js file and create smaller components. These would be something like the render being a separate component and the filter another.
    Create unit test for these components using Jest.
    Create better error logging on the axios call.
